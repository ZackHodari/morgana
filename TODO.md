# TODO

- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Add functionality for saving and using config files (maybe using [abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py)).
- [ ] Integrate [Ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) with experiment_builder to allow for easier modification of
        training routines.
- [ ] Improve handling of loading dataset level information, i.e. generalise what is currently in place for normalisers.
