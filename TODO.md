# TODO

- [ ] Integrate [Ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) with experiment_builder to allow for easier modification of
        training routines.
- [ ] Add functionality for saving and using config files (maybe using [abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py)).
- [ ] Handle necessity for loading dataset level information (i.e. not with train_data_sources), maybe also combine this
        with loading nornalisers.
